# Template p5 project

Artistâ€™s statement for "ABJECT WORKPLACE"

My aim with this project was to capture the feeling of alienation and anxiety that results from being subjected to the depraved whims of the capitalist class. For the setting, I was directly inspired by the horrific treatment of workers such as those at Amazon or the recently locked out Kellogg's employees. Out of respect for the very real struggle of the working class, I wanted to imagine a nightmarish, fantasy version of a Silicon Valley factory hellscape. What I came up with was some industrial techno, flashing lights, and a freaky blob boss that barks robotic orders at you. The job simulation itself involves a rote task of moving products from one conveyor belt to another, though in this instance the products are strangely coloured skulls. This is probably meant to say something about the ongoing history of imperialism and violence enacted by the capitalists on the rest of us.

There are many, many missing features and ideas that I wish I had had time to add. I am typing this 40 minutes before the midnight due date, desperately wishing I had had the chance to add in different end states based off of how much money was made. Currently, the instructions aren't very clear in game, though I am also slightly into the semi-obscurity of it, which I think mimics the first day at a new job quite well.

My main gripe is that I am still struggling with timers. This was a major bug in my midterm project and somehow I find myself back in a similar position! Right now the timer starts at the beginning of the whole simulation, which means its already counting down before you start. I tried to fix this but to no avail.

I see this as a demo version of a project I'd like to fully round out. I have many other ideas for different difficulty levels, more products, other timers (bathroom and punishment bars!), and status effects that change the sizes of the products and make it more physically difficult to move the mouse around.

I made all of the assets, both the visuals and the music. I did a lot of 3D sculpting, to a render, to either premiere or photoshop to fixed up or turned into gifs. I also compressed the hell out of the gifs in the hopes that it would be lightweight enough to function.

I look forward to learning more in this class, though I am so proud of the fact that only a few months ago I had no idea how to code at all, and now here I am making a bizarre interactive nightmare.

Thank you for all your work!

Basic instructions for the game:
Fill up the bar in the top left-hand corner and you will get to keep your job.
Do so by dragging the correct products (skulls) onto the dropzone (white area) within the time limit.
