Hello! This is my simulation for Project 1. It simulates a solar system with some limited interactivity
in the form of left and right movement of the celestial bodies along a predefined axis. I made all of
the assets for this project.

I've had help from both Pippin and Mads for this project, especially in regards to wrapping my head
around how to get the fundamental radial mechanic.

Mads and I spent a significant amount of time trying to debug the program's inability to reset properly,
but hit a wall with it. Not sure what I'm missing, but its clearly something to do with the superNova.

The bug currently makes it impossible to restart the simulation after completing the program once and
returning to the title screen.

I am eager to learn how to better use arrays! And how to properly organize/ optimize my code, because
currently this whole thing feels veeeeerrrry long and cumbersome. Anywho, thanks for all the help!!
